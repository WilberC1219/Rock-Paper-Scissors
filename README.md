The game is the classic rock paper scissors where there are two players that simultaneously choose rock, paper or scissors to use against their opponent. The rules are as follows: Scissors beats Paper, Paper beats Rock, and Rock beats Scissors.

In my game, you will go against the computer. Between you and the computer, whoever is able to win 3 out of 5 rounds of rock, paper, scissors first will be declared the winner of the game.

Before playing any rounds, below the regulation that states "The first player to win 3 out of 5 rounds is the winner", there is a label for the player and computer. Below each player's label, there's a box with a "?". Once the human player begins playing with the computer, the "?" icons will change to each player's chosen item (rock, paper, or scissors) for each round, and below those boxes, there will be small text stating if you won the round or lost the round and why.

At the bottom of the page, you will notice two containers. Each container contains information about which player it belongs to (top left corner), the score of the respective player (top right corner), and the three choices that the player can make (bottom three buttons of the container). The closed fist hand represents "rock", the open hand with all figures out is "paper", and the hand with two fingers out is "scissors".

In order to choose one of the three, simply hover your mouse over and click on the button, and the round will be played. Once the game is over (either the human player or computer won 3 out of 5 rounds), you will be prompted if you would like to play again. If you would like to play again, simply click the play again button.

The game is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and it has an animation when the player and computer make their selections.
